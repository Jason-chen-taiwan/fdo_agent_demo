# FDO Server Deployment Tool

## Overview

This tool provides an automated deployment flow for FIDO Device Onboarding (FDO) server implementation. It allows monitoring and control of agent resources such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and other system metrics.

## Features

- Automated FDO server deployment
- Agent resource monitoring
- System metrics collection (CPU, Memory, etc.)
- Remote agent control capabilities

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Python 3.8+
- Network connectivity to target agents
- FDO compatible devices/agents

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fdo-server-tool
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file with the following settings:

```yaml
server:
  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8080

monitoring:
  interval: 30 # seconds
  metrics:
    - cpu
    - memory
    - disk
    - network

agents:
  timeout: 60
  retry_attempts: 3
```

## Usage

1. Start the FDO server:

```bash
python fdo_server.py
```

2. Monitor agent resources:

```bash
python monitor.py --agent-id <agent_id>
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /agents` - List all connected agents
- `GET /agents/{id}/metrics` - Get agent metrics
- `POST /agents/{id}/control` - Send control commands
